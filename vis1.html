<h2 class="title"> Visualization 1: Extrapolated Points of SCF Teams </h2>
<p class="description">For my first variation, I decided to try to take a more open ended approach to the original donut
    chart design by implementing an aster plot. In this visual, each slice represents a SCF team with SCF Winners/Losers
    being shown by green/red respectively. The outerRadius in the visual represents the Points(extrapolated) teams received
    over the course of the season. The outer black ring represents the mean Points a SCF team received.</p>
