<h2 class="title"> Visualization 2: Normalized PDO of SCF Teams </h2>
<p class="description">In my second variation I decided to continue exploring aster plots as I was pleased with the general
    design. I decided to explore normalized PDO data because without normalization, PDO varies by only 0.039 from the smallest
    to largest. I decided to keep the idea of using a black ring from variation 1 to represent normalized mean PDO. </p>
