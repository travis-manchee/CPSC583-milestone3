<h2 class="title"> Visualization 3: Normalized PDO of SCF Teams from Mean Normalized PDO </h2>
<p class="description">In my third variation I decided to further explore normalized PDO data, my main goal was to find
    a more visually distinctive way of showing the differences in PDO between teams. I decided that instead of showing
    the normalized data from 0 to 100 (normalized range), I would show the data as positive/negative change from the mean
    normalized PDO by showing the colour extending outwards/inwards from the black ring that represents the mean. The
    result is a visual that is much more relational which is great for making comparisons.</p>
